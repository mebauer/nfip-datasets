# How to Download NFIP Datasets from OpenFEMA
Author: Mark Bauer

# Overview
This repository demonstrates how to download and work with the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) [datasets](https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/data-sets#nfip) from [OpenFEMA](https://www.fema.gov/about/reports-and-data/openfema). The workflows use the Python programming language and are sdesigned to be efficient, easy to adapt, and easy to understand. These examples also include brief data exploration using [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/).

The tutorial can be found in the [download-examples](https://github.com/mebauer/nfip-datasets/blob/main/download-examples.ipynb) notebook.

Notes:  
- Datasets are downloaded in Parquet format whenever possible for performance and compatibility.
- DuckDB is used for querying and previewing the data.
- The NFIP Community Layers dataset is large and has been excluded from this repository (tracked via .gitignore), but other datasets are included both locally and on GitHub.
- For the NFIP Policies and Claims datasets, the current focus is on a sample of New York City.
